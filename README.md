Pyglet-gui is an extension of [Pyglet](http://www.pyglet.org/) for graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
Thanks for checking it out.

This project started as a fork of [Kytten](https://code.google.com/p/kytten/),
but ended up being a new project by its own right since the API changed dramatically.

This project is in pre-alpha.

Main features
--------------

* Implements the controller-viewer pattern.

    Pyglet-gui uses the concept of "Controllers" to handle events and "Widgets" to draw.

    It provides both low-level interfaces, such as two-state controllers,
    and end-user interfaces, such as buttons,
    which can be further extended.

* Use of Mixins

    Pyglet-gui uses mixins for extending functionality of viewers and controllers.
    This minimizes repetition and increases code reusability.

* Implements an abstraction for graphical appearance

    Pyglet-gui uses the concept of "theme", on which each (static) resource is defined in a JSON file.
    This file is loaded into a "theme" that is used by widgets to load resources.

    This decouples the laying out of elements from its graphical appearance. You can create your own themes,
    or extend the existing one.
